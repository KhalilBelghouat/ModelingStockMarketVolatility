# Modeling Stock Market Volatility

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "Modeling Stock Market Volatility" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, we apply symetric and asymetric GARCH models to one of Morocco stock indices, namely, the MADEX index. In addition, we employ extreme value theory in order to model the tail risk of the stock index daily log-returns.
