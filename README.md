# Modeling Stock Market Volatility

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "Modeling Stock Market Volatility" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, we apply symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models to one of Morocco stock indices, namely, the MADEX index. 

## Prerequisites

The ```R``` programming language, version 4.0.3, and its statistical and machine learning libraries were used to build all applied models. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.
